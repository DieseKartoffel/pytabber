Windows will only show the ALT-TAB window on the main monitor. If you use multiple displays this can be very annoying.

Run this program in the background and press ALT+q anytime to show program-selection-window on every screen.

You can use PyInstaller to create an .exe and place it in the Windows AutoStart folder.
